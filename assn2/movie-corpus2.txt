<id>1</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>in my opinion , a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned . however , protocol forces me to do otherwise . rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion . when the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian , it's clich ? d . carpenter's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . carpenter's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . and guess what ? this movie has both ! not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . since there's no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . that's a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . carpenter can't even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it . [the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats . -ed . ] when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts . regardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity . why wouldn't they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? the cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes . i felt sorry for affleck , who i've liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty . and i'm not even getting into luke wilson's role as a priest . bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it . rating : * [lowest rating] |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| mpaa rating : pg-13 </review>
<id>2</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>you can watch this movie , that is based on a sci-fi work by robert heinlein , either as a straight gung-ho war film , or you can see it mostly as a spoof . anyway you watch it won't require too much gray matter from your brain cells , because you will either find this film entertaining and a feast for weary eyes , or you might , like me , " think " that this film is so bad that it really couldn't be this bad , i must be missing something . but i have come to the conclusion that this insipid b- movie , is that bad , despite the high production costs it took to make it . if there are any good parts to this film , it might be in the occasional sardonic one liner , such as this one , that makes light of the film's heavy assault on our sensibilities , as one soldier is telling the hero of the story , " you're good at killing bugs . " basically , the film should be seen as a war movie , because its spoof of the military , grew thin very fast for me , as it got carried away with the cartoon characters it has stereotyped , going for an overkill on a spoof that is so obvious in the first place , that by spending so much time with spoofing the military , is just plain unnecessary . i guess the film is set in the future , but it sure looks like the present to me despite all the computer graphics , as it makes use of its astronomical budget to become solely a computerized special effect movie , that should endear itself to the mtv generation . after awhile , all the performers looked alike to me , but i wouldn't be doing my duty as a movie reviewer , if i should fail to point out that there is some kind of melodramatic love story going down among the four stars of the film , rico ( casper van dien ) , the school football hero , loves carmen ( denise richards ) , the school beauty and math brain , who is set on becoming a pilot , which is the reason rico joins the military . i don't think you get much bang for your money out of this film , unless you are really into special effects or found this sophomoric satire funny or you are a reactionary , then i think you will find many things to like about this empty hearted attempt to put ww11 into an outer space conflagration film . </review>
<id>3</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>this is asking a lot to believe , and though it is possible , it would have been more possible to believe if quentin possessed some charm or something about him that would give us a clue that he was such a good catch , because he sure couldn't act , and since he is the focal point of all the attention , able to have his way with either men or women , we should also have felt this electricity generated on screen , instead of being forced fed by the director into believing something was happening when we couldn't see it . just what was supposed to be so compelling about this relationship , that would make it interesting ? i'm afraid i don't have the answer , since i can't find a thing about this relationship or this movie that kept me tuned into it , as i tended to drift out of the story somewhere in the middle , and just watched for the street scenes of paris in the background , which i found to be more pleasurable viewing than the movie itself , even more erotic than the unerotic love scenes between the lovers , and this is being said by a big fan of isabelle huppert , who is usually quite engaging in the various roles she has played during her long career , but here it is embarrassing for me to watch her vacuous performance . the only problem with this , is that we didn't see how good the sex was , we had to take the word of the actors that it was so good , as dialogue came out of their mouths that is totally forgetable or regretable or whatever , but their love was not passionate or credible . there is one line from the film that summed up how i really felt about what i was seeing , when at a fashion party for dominque's wealthy parisian fashion clients , quentin tells her , " seeing all these rich people makes me want to puke . " quentin must be psychic or something , because he was just regurgitating what i was thinking about the characters in this film . </review>
<id>4</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>no heroes and no story are the main attributes for this futile attempt at a trainspotting , performance , the long good friday , and a tarantino-like gangster/comedy , all rolled into one film , served up with an eastender's sense of vile english humor , as this is writer/director guy ritchie's first feature film , formerly known for his video commercials . he tries every bit he could muster from the lore of gangster and screwball comedies , to make this film work , but still misses by a city mile . this is just a bad film . a laurel and hardy film would have looked like deep sardonic humor compared with this sophomoric effort . every character in the film tries to be a character , succeeding only in being a one-dimensional one , while women do not play a significant part in this unoriginal film , as they are reduced to being go-go girls or unnoticeable druggies . ritchie's aim for the film , is to keep the audience guessing at what is happening . the film gets carried away with trying to be too clever , as one character is always trying to top the other in craziness . the plot has its twists and turns , and it would serve no purpose telling you about it , since the heart of the film , is about the surprises and corpses it delivers . since the film's humor didn't suit me and i grew tired of seeing so many characters try to fit into such a small movie , with all of them being a composite of a boring and motley crew of stereotypes ; and , the violence didn't particularly appeal to me , either , leaving me squirming in my seat with displeasure . if you take my advise , you'd avoid this one . i think you would get more satisfaction , if you are hooked on this type of film , in seeing something like reservoir dogs , even if you must see it again , it is better than seeing this poor imitation once . </review>
<id>5</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>this is not an art movie , yet i saw it an art house theater . it is perfect for the mall , where teenagers experiencing brain drains can feel good about being mindless and not have to apologize that this is an american film , about that old cliche of young lovers relentlessly on the run . if seen at your friendly mall , you could , at least , be reassured that there is little chance of anyone trying to sneak it in as an art film , as was tried in the art house . rlr should make it apparent that other countries can make obnoxious films with banal and predictable characters just as readily as americans can . there is no substance in this fast food german meal , served up at a deliciously kinetic speed so that you have no time to think about how stupid the story is and how depraved the lead characters are , and what a lousy meal you have just had . the film is as deep as reading a daffy duck comic book or playing a road runner video game or watching a bugs bunny cartoon , and if that entertains you , then perhaps , i could recommend that you take a look at run lola run , it might be what you are looking for . it has the audacity to have in its opening credits a quote from t . s . in all probability , the blue-bloodied elliott would not have cared for this film- and to quote him and then have a film that has nothing in the world to do with his poem or with the quote , except to show that even these crass critters who created this film aspire to a higher art form , is simply a ridiculous attempt by them to try and achieve credibility when it is not necessary to do so , this film stands on its own four paws . these questions once asked on screen are , of course , never even attempted to be answered . though it would have been good comedic dialogue to have the two leads , lola ( franka potente ) and manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) , try to resolve these deep philosophical questions . what does take place is a soccer ball being kicked to open the action in the film , as the movie is supposed to be like a game , with the director making up the rules as he goes along . manni , not to be undone , sports a few nifty tattoos himself , while also taking on the punk look . the fun to this story , if you are going to have any , comes in following lola as she makes a run for it through spots that she will revisit three different times each for 20-minutes and with three different versions , before the film is over , as any one of the versions could be true or none of them could be true , it just doesn't matter . nothing matters , here . this is a disposable film , like junk food , when done you throw it in the waste can . needless to say , anything goes here ; this film does not try to make sense and it doesn't . its comedy is on the low end of the totem pole of comedy , though the old silent comedians , such as charlie chaplin and buster keaton did bits similar to this , but they had a logic to their madcap humor and knew how to tell a story in their comedy . there are so many films that tried this theme out for size , some successfully like rashomon ( 1950 ) , some modestly successful like blind chance ( 1982 ) , others less successfully , such as sliding doors ( 1998 ) , but none as unsuccessful as this one . at least this subtitled , low-budget film flew by quickly and leaves you no worst for wear after seeing it . . . it certainly didn't appeal to me ; i was just not smitten with its attempt to be such a cleverly edited , jejune summer film . and he replies , " i just know . " well , i just know i didn't like this film . </review>
<id>6</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>a satirical film where warren beatty tries to talk the black man's rap to get across his political message : which is that there's something wrong in politics that corrupts everyone in it . maybe he does this because he feels relieved that he's going to die soon . this is an awkardly embarrassing scene , that was more embarrassing than funny to watch beatty try to ingratiate himself this way to his black brothers . it reminded me in an analogous way of the liberals in the '60s who invited the black panthers into their wealthy homes and thought they were so chic . even frank capra wasn't that schmaltzy . the story gets too ridiculous at this point to even be satirical or credible , it is just bad filmmaking ; but it does try in its unclear and scrambled way to blame the media and the rich people who control it , for not being risk takers and offering fresh arguments into the political fray . amiri baraka ( poet & playwright ) , supposedly a voice of consciousness , plays a homeless wiseman who keeps popping up from scene-to-scene , uttering this heavy stream of consciousness rap , " we need no more ghosts , we need a spirit . " the fault of the film , is that beatty can't gracefully pull off what he is trying to accomplish without appearing to be smug about it , like he's the white man who knows best what to do , and that anything he does is super cool because he really cares about the blacks and the poor ( sic ) . everyone in the film is a cardboard prop for beatty to lay it into them with his political cliches . just when i thought wag the dog was the stupidest political comedy i ever saw , along comes this sophomoric venture , showing no plausible way of replacing the old lies of senator bulworth with his new so-called truths , and as a result it is a film that out wags the dog's tail in silliness and prattle , unable to have the demented bulworth say what he would do when elected , except what is implied , that the people will trust him because he's so hip and daring , and he's just so with it . there was a smugness about this film that made its childish political voice seem more annoying than it should be , even taking away any enjoyment that might have been derived from its comic efforts . beatty is just not the filmmaker i would want telling my side of the story . all he has done is make a film that is cliched and overbearing and funny in a not funny way , and he sounds no different or trustworthy than the politicians he features in the film , clinton and dole . and , i don't mean that as a compliment . </review>
<id>7</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>this sci-fi'er left a lot to be desired . it didn't work out in 3-d , its original intention of how it was to be shown , as the public's taste for that fad cooled , or in the conventional 2-d , how it was actually shown when released . for the first 30 minutes or so i felt i was stuck in a detention classroom for dummies ( ah ! even if these machines could do a 1 , 000 times the work man can do , they were also a 1 , 000 times deadlier than man , and this reactionary story dwells on the negative side of what machines could do , even if the machine in this instance is a magnificent brain . the action in the film , which is none too thrilling , is in watching how many of the 150 workers will get killed and what novel ways are the killings to be done . if the film was funny or its technology was more interesting , or if the killings weren't so melodramatic , and the acting not so staid , and the patriotic jingoism wasn't so shrill , i might have found this film bearable . but since that wasn't the case , i found the film to be an academic bore . </review>
<id>8</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>this is a dull , unfunny film , lacking an edge to it , as if the screenwriter is past his prime and maybe should take a year off to re-gain his touch . this sitcom film is actually worst than most sitcoms seen on tv ; it should have come with canned laughter . in the theater i saw it , no one laughed ; and , watching a comedy without hearing any laughs gives me a creepy feeling . the film lacked the kind of comedy expected for a satire . even if the story never took off , i at least expected the film to have some snappy things to say about those who are part of the hollywood establishment and not to mirror it so closely with the hollywood scene that it can't even be considered a parody anymore . i thought brooks mailed this script in . it was hard to think of brooks as a victim of hollywood when he was surrounded by so much wealth and the only thing he strove for was to become even wealthier . he never asked the muse to inspire him to write a great classic , only for some " summer script " he can sell to the studios as a blockbuster movie . if he was trying for a parody ( which i assume he was ) , he just didn't succeed . all he succeeded in showing was that there is some bitterness in him and that he's part of the " fat cats " who make up the hollywood scene , too complacent to make a real satire with some bite in it . but i think the main problem with the film , besides the fact that it's a one idea film , is how that idea was weak and never developed . the brooks character never spelled out why he was so desperate in the first place and he never showed us how good a writer he was . i feel i must question the film's intent : why should i feel sorry for brooks ? where is the comedy in the film ? what is this nonsense about getting a live muse supposed to mean ? what kind of statement is he making about creativity ? should i really believe that someone would have the chutzpah to make a film about a screenwriter who lost his touch and pays for a muse so he can get that touch back and makes a film that is so flat and uninspired ? is he trying to tell me that people in hollywood will believe in anything and so should i ? and there you have the funniest line in the film and it comes right in the beginning of the film . what goes for comedy in this film , has to do with his whiny relationship to the muse . that dumbness prevails , and he comes up with a lame idea for a film in which he wants to have jim carrey star in , is supposed to be his way of saying that hollywood doesn't know what's good from what's crap , or doesn't care . this is " i love lucy " kind of humor . that this film is about making money being tantamount in hollywood to creativity , is a theme that has been often done and this film has not touched on any new ground with that concept . if you make a satire , it better be funny , or if it is a more serious film , it should try to have a script with some characters who are profound and perceptive . to have a satire with nothing to dig into is unfortunate , as brooks chose to go for his laughs by having his character be a whiner , grousing about the demands of his muse , the attention she gives to his wife instead of him , how steven spielberg snubbed him , and how cruel it is to be in hollywood if you are a creative person . this slight aim at comedy turns this film into a slight film . if you really had to see this film , the only reason i could think of doing so , was to see the attractive sharon stone as a muse . even though the script did not provide her with material that was funny , she did show by her facial expressions and body language that she has a penchant for comedy if given a chance . at least she was more lovable than any one else in the film was . </review>
<id>9</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>instead he makes him an offer he can't very well refuse , stay with me and i'll give you everything you want . it all turns out to be a tedious game to see who is in control : brains or brawn . the kid plays his part like he's a lump of coal and the sex is so uninviting , making it seem just as boring as watching paint dry on a wall . and like all the characters in this film , is not developed . there is no rhyme or reason for all this sleaze to be taking place , except for making the audience into voyeurs , like the invalid . what is quickly resolved , is that glover isn't queer , just manipulaive and mentally sick . that explanation of him doesn't ring true , anyway , as he always has a blank and uninteresting look on his face , and nothing he does throughout the film is taking him to anything but a dead-end . so it becomes hard to feel anything for him , but pity and contempt . the sadistic games are better delivered now with the presence of helen , but the menage a trois doesn't have the nuances , wit , or actors to pull off the macabre effects it was trying desperately to get away with . it becomes obvious that glover has a death-wish and has been preparing all-the-time for this and now seems ready , as he reads from a poem by a zen monk who is about to die , which goes something like this-- " in all my 56-years alive , i've seen no miracles . it is okay to die today . but even that attempt to get some life into the story fizzled , as the film just wound down trying to outsmart itself with shockers to its denouement , but ended up not being a very thrilling thriller or even living up to its reputation of being a controversial film . it was just a dull , exploitive movie , distinguished only by the fine performance of a good actor , pete postlethwaite , who was overwhelmed by being in such a trying film . </review>
<id>10</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>vibrant culture . great people . thinking of hanging out here for a while . eat the rich . if i got a postcard like that , i would think of getting a new best friend . this is a story which turns out to be so flat and without emotion and plays like a film you can almost swear you saw before even if you didn't , that's how forgettable and regretable the story and the acting are . it almost makes you wonder what the filmmaker is trying to say about this trite conundrum his protaganist has . the film never comes to any surprises or reveals anything you wouldn't have known if you didn't see the film . which is why , i would think the sensible thing to do for those who value how they spend their time , would be to avoid this one . at least , that's what i would do if i had it to do over . but that's not to say that the film was so terrible that it can't be seen , that would not be true , since it is not so bad as it is a case of it being so dull that it negates any enjoyment value . why toni is a poet , we have to take as a statement of fact coming from the filmmaker , because he appears like an obnoxious jerk and an actor who is badly miscast , and there was no evidence given in the film that he shows even enough intelligence to spell poet , let alone to even consider him to be a poet . chris , as a bohemian , was too pathetic to seriously believe and not funny enough to laugh at . but what was really laughable , was the filmmaker's bourgeois conception of what a bohemian is . what's left for the story to tell , are those predictable scenes of the friend who is not the friend he pretends to be , but someone who is jealous of his friend' material comforts and satisfying marriage . there's a new bresson playing . " this film will not be mistaken for a bresson . trust me on that . the film was able to muster one great line of dialogue , and it comes from marion , as she tells her hapless hubby , " you will get married because you are not original enough not to . " </review>
