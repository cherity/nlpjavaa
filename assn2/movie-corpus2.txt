<id>1</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>in my opinion , a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned . however , protocol forces me to do otherwise . rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion . when the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian , it's clich ? d . carpenter's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . carpenter's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . and guess what ? this movie has both ! not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . since there's no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . that's a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . carpenter can't even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it . [the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats . -ed . ] when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts . regardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity . why wouldn't they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? the cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes . i felt sorry for affleck , who i've liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty . and i'm not even getting into luke wilson's role as a priest . bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it . rating : * [lowest rating] |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| mpaa rating : pg-13 </review>
<id>2</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>you can watch this movie , that is based on a sci-fi work by robert heinlein , either as a straight gung-ho war film , or you can see it mostly as a spoof . anyway you watch it won't require too much gray matter from your brain cells , because you will either find this film entertaining and a feast for weary eyes , or you might , like me , " think " that this film is so bad that it really couldn't be this bad , i must be missing something . but i have come to the conclusion that this insipid b- movie , is that bad , despite the high production costs it took to make it . if there are any good parts to this film , it might be in the occasional sardonic one liner , such as this one , that makes light of the film's heavy assault on our sensibilities , as one soldier is telling the hero of the story , " you're good at killing bugs . " basically , the film should be seen as a war movie , because its spoof of the military , grew thin very fast for me , as it got carried away with the cartoon characters it has stereotyped , going for an overkill on a spoof that is so obvious in the first place , that by spending so much time with spoofing the military , is just plain unnecessary . i guess the film is set in the future , but it sure looks like the present to me despite all the computer graphics , as it makes use of its astronomical budget to become solely a computerized special effect movie , that should endear itself to the mtv generation . after awhile , all the performers looked alike to me , but i wouldn't be doing my duty as a movie reviewer , if i should fail to point out that there is some kind of melodramatic love story going down among the four stars of the film , rico ( casper van dien ) , the school football hero , loves carmen ( denise richards ) , the school beauty and math brain , who is set on becoming a pilot , which is the reason rico joins the military . i don't think you get much bang for your money out of this film , unless you are really into special effects or found this sophomoric satire funny or you are a reactionary , then i think you will find many things to like about this empty hearted attempt to put ww11 into an outer space conflagration film . </review>
<id>3</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>this is asking a lot to believe , and though it is possible , it would have been more possible to believe if quentin possessed some charm or something about him that would give us a clue that he was such a good catch , because he sure couldn't act , and since he is the focal point of all the attention , able to have his way with either men or women , we should also have felt this electricity generated on screen , instead of being forced fed by the director into believing something was happening when we couldn't see it . just what was supposed to be so compelling about this relationship , that would make it interesting ? i'm afraid i don't have the answer , since i can't find a thing about this relationship or this movie that kept me tuned into it , as i tended to drift out of the story somewhere in the middle , and just watched for the street scenes of paris in the background , which i found to be more pleasurable viewing than the movie itself , even more erotic than the unerotic love scenes between the lovers , and this is being said by a big fan of isabelle huppert , who is usually quite engaging in the various roles she has played during her long career , but here it is embarrassing for me to watch her vacuous performance . the only problem with this , is that we didn't see how good the sex was , we had to take the word of the actors that it was so good , as dialogue came out of their mouths that is totally forgetable or regretable or whatever , but their love was not passionate or credible . there is one line from the film that summed up how i really felt about what i was seeing , when at a fashion party for dominque's wealthy parisian fashion clients , quentin tells her , " seeing all these rich people makes me want to puke . " quentin must be psychic or something , because he was just regurgitating what i was thinking about the characters in this film . </review>
<id>4</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>1</star><review>no heroes and no story are the main attributes for this futile attempt at a trainspotting , performance , the long good friday , and a tarantino-like gangster/comedy , all rolled into one film , served up with an eastender's sense of vile english humor , as this is writer/director guy ritchie's first feature film , formerly known for his video commercials . he tries every bit he could muster from the lore of gangster and screwball comedies , to make this film work , but still misses by a city mile . this is just a bad film . a laurel and hardy film would have looked like deep sardonic humor compared with this sophomoric effort . every character in the film tries to be a character , succeeding only in being a one-dimensional one , while women do not play a significant part in this unoriginal film , as they are reduced to being go-go girls or unnoticeable druggies . ritchie's aim for the film , is to keep the audience guessing at what is happening . the film gets carried away with trying to be too clever , as one character is always trying to top the other in craziness . the plot has its twists and turns , and it would serve no purpose telling you about it , since the heart of the film , is about the surprises and corpses it delivers . since the film's humor didn't suit me and i grew tired of seeing so many characters try to fit into such a small movie , with all of them being a composite of a boring and motley crew of stereotypes ; and , the violence didn't particularly appeal to me , either , leaving me squirming in my seat with displeasure . if you take my advise , you'd avoid this one . i think you would get more satisfaction , if you are hooked on this type of film , in seeing something like reservoir dogs , even if you must see it again , it is better than seeing this poor imitation once . </review>
<id>1002</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>4</star><review>it is about the effects of war on some taiwanese patriots and appears to be inaccessible until it slowly becomes clear what the masterful director is up to . the story is multi-layered as it uses as its theme the crimes against citizens during the anti-communist campaign waged during the 1950s , giving it a complexity that requires the viewer to have a resolve to stick with this gloomy tale that is shot with a static camera and takes place in three different time periods ( past , present , and in the imagination ) . the reward is seeing a great bit of filmmaking that comes from the heart . this is being enacted in a film starring liang ching . as the red army fought for control of china , chiang kai-shek -- supported by the americans -- rooted out all communists by force . the movie's title she's in is : good men , good women . the film offers much to ponder about the lessons from the past and how rotten both sides can be during war . it's a smoothly accomplished film of a 'film within a film , ' as it uses memories that are personal and those that are part of history to show how we can't easily distinguish the two . by the film's conclusion we feel the personal loss of both men who were killed , even though one might have been an innocent victim and the other might have got what he deserved . it's an unusual film that is always challenging and intelligent . annie shizuka inoh in the role of these women from different generations , gives an inspiring performance that evokes a genuine sympathy . </review>
<id>1003</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>4</star><review>how could i have imagined as i was making this film that the stifling sense of longing that fills the screen was to become my lot for the rest of my life ; that from now until the end of my days i would bear the painful malady within myself ? " for that reason , seeing how the filmmaker himself was pleased with the film and considered it so important to himself , and because of the power and perfection of craft the film exhibited , it makes it that much easier for me to say that this film ranks as one of his best works , an intriguing masterpiece , that is equal to , if not better than his other masterpieces , solaris , andrei rublyov , the sacrifice , and mirror . the visual images of all the scarved peasant ladies with lit candles and starlings coming out of the virgin's body are , indeed , startling . the mood of the film is gloomy , when a laugh is heard or someone does something silly it is monumental and takes on an unreal scope . the feeling one gets , is somewhat as if a child , saddened by the outside world , is nevertheless able to laugh at something he makes up , and thereby feels good about himself . when the sacristan's response is , " what are you here for , then ? " the best and truest lines in the film are spoken by the madman . the people are much like the weathermen who can give you the temperature , but are lost when the conversation takes a deeper turn , they are simply not prepared to talk about what they do not comprehend . for tarkovsky , this film is a lifetime journey , made by someone who is in pain and must see this pain through for what it is , because there is no going ahead without taking this pain with him . things do not seem so foreign to him , anymore . </review>
<id>1004</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>4</star><review>melville establishes his exquisite control of the subject matter by allowing the story to unfold in such a perfect manner . i suspect , not many directors have that kind of grace and understanding of life . . . melville's sense of how to tell a story has influenced many directors through his long career starting in the late 40s , and that list would include the great director , bresson , who developed the same style and feel for filmmaking as melville , who at times outdoes melville's melville , giving some the false impression that melville imitated bresson . melville's success comes through the intelligent use he makes of his eye for seeing what is spiritual and what is intelligent , and allowing it to be emotionally compelling . his argument for a god couldn't be put forth with more verve and intelligence , even though it didn't convince me , as he was not challenged with counter arguments by any one in the film who had the ability to present a cogent differing opinion , nevertheless , this film moved me to further expand what i think . . . it even shows that it is possible to have a truly spiritual person be a part of the church , something that i have rarely come across outside the cinema . </review>
<id>1005</id><reviewer>A</reviewer><star>4</star><review>goldfish , for the iranian celebrants , are symbols of life . what is truly amazing about this masterly done film , is how gracefully it uses real time to take you into the countdown for the new year , that is marked off by repeated radio reminders . by this time , we are sucked into accepting the importance the money and goldfish has for the girl , it is not unlike our christmas time desire to please our children with gifts , whether or not the gifts are worth it or not , they have an intrinsic value above their real worth , and we feel so happy when we see the joy in their eyes when they receive their gifts . the brilliance of the film , is that the story that unfolds is about the little girl's adventure with the shop owners and the strangers in the street she is not supposed to talk to but does , and how caught up in it we get because it is so human a story ; it is something that is universally understood , that we forget that we are talking about iran , the country that we demonized , our arch enemy ; and , if the film can be criticized , it is for glossing over any of the numerous wrongs in their society that could be criticized but are not . though , i think , that might be unfair to say , since the movie should be judged for its own sake and not for any outside political reasons . this is a great final shot of the white balloon in the air , that is not contrived or pretentious , but is genuinely a heartfelt and memorable moment of the film , topping off a very human film , that might surprise a lot of people that it was made in modern iran . the white balloon is a masterpiece in its simplicity , and the way its tale of the human condition is so easily related without demeaning the people involved ; and , how childhood is explored , pointing out how a child tries to grow up when faced with adversity , are unmatched in most hollywood films . if i had to compare it to any film that i have seen , i think of de sica's the bicycle thief and see some of the same values about life in both films . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net </review>
