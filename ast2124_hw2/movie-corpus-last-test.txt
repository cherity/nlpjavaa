<id>2371</id><review>producers : ivan reitman and joel silver . director : ivan reitman . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 101 minutes . i don't even need to have seen the infotainment show interviews of billy crystal and robin williams to know the substance of them . " well , " billy/robin would say , " robin/billy and i have been looking for a long time for a project where we could work together , and fathers' day seemed like the perfect opportunity . " " yeah , " robin/billy would then chime in , " we had a great time making it . " whereupon would ensue much good-natured riffing between the two , guaranteed to have the hosts chuckling merrily as we returned to the studio . for those uninitiated in promo-speak , allow me to provide a translation . the real plot of fathers' day is robin williams and billy crystal running around being robin williams and billy crystal . that plot shouldn't have been too hard to pull off . crystal and williams are funny , talented men , and the screenwriting team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandel has produced charmers like splash , parenthood and city slickers . fathers' day , however , isn't merely disappointing . it is one of the laziest and most ineptly constructed comedies of the decade . i spent 101 minutes staring at a screen in blank-faced astonishment , waiting for this group of talented people to show me something remotely entertaining . of course , i knew the answer to that question . they were thinking that they had robin williams and billy crystal , and that everything else would just sort itself out . fathers' day is filled with scenes where it looked like the script consisted of the phrase " robin does something crazy here . " it is the rare film which has made good use of williams' improvisational skills -- good morning , vietnam comes to mind . more frequently , a careless creative team like this one will use williams as a comedic " in-a-gadda-da-vida " drum solo , filling time between " fade in " and " fade out . " crystal isn't even _that_ lucky , consigned with the rest of the cast to picking up whatever scraps williams leaves behind . he plays the felix unger in this odd couple road show , maintaining the same vaguely perturbed expression for roughly the entire film . you might think fathers' day would be built around the conflict between the opposing personalities of the two leads -- crystal as the uptight lawyer and williams as the unhinged creative type -- but you'd be wrong . williams and crystal hardly raise their voices to one another , perhaps fearing that the audience only wants to see them as funny chums . respectively , they provide the opportunity to watch a mosh pit full of head-butting and a port-a-potty sliding down a hillside . thanks for coming . most critics tend to reserve their greatest outrage for films featuring pauly shore , chris farley or even jim carrey , perhaps believing that moronic physical comedy is what's wrong with modern film-making . i consider fathers' day more contemptible by far . whatever else one might think about farley or carrey , they give everything they've got to a role . the performances are lifeless , the plot incorporates that over-used trope of the workaholic who gets religion about family life , and the dialogue is so devoid of creativity that it re-cycles a gag about the odds of lou gehrig dying of lou gehrig's disease ( comparative stories about how long ago you first heard that one mailed to this address , please ) . i'm sure the stars had a wonderful time making fathers' day , just like burt reynolds , dom deluise and company had a wonderful time making those cannonball run movies . as the credits started to role , i began to hope that fathers' day would include out-takes , something to justify my time . they also would have provided a fitting post-card coda for a film which amounts to a working vacation for robin williams and billy crystal at our expense : " having a good time -- glad you were there .

<id>2372</id><review>screenplay : jill mazursky cody and jeffrey abrams . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , violent situations ) running time : 92 minutes . i was sitting next to a laugher as i watched gone fishin' . when i say " laugher , " i don't just mean someone who laughs loudly , or someone who laughs frequently . i mean someone who laughs loudly _and_ frequently . the most innocuous line of dialogue was greeted with a hearty chuckle , while a full-fledged sight gag inspired the kind of explosive bellow which i was certain would cause a loss of bladder control . if disney had test-screened gone fishin' for an audience comprised entirely of clones of this fellow , the champagne corks would have been popping like bubble wrap in the hands of a 10-year-old . under most circumstances , the laugher would have annoyed me to distraction . in the case of gone fishin' , the distraction was welcome . the film's breathtaking awfulness forced my mind to wander in sheer self-defense , leading me to spend a lot of time thinking about what a splendid time the laugher was having . as a critic , it is sometimes useful for me to confront how uniquely personal the movie-going experience can be , particularly when it comes to comedy . in my world , gone fishin' was a complete catastrophe . in the laugher's world , it was an unqualified delight . there's certainly nothing inherently clever about the premise . and that , ultimately , is what gone fishin' is about . in other words , it's in the tradition of the slapstick-y live-action comedies disney made when dean jones and kurt russell were foiling the nefarious schemes of joe flynn and cesar romero in various permutations . at least those concoctions were fast-paced and enthusiastically silly . for every two minutes of action in gone fishin' there are at least twenty minutes of inane chatter between pesci and glover . the two are supposed to be lovable , incurably optimistic simpletons , but someone forgot to spend any script time on the " lovable " part . joe and gus are dull , immature and , worst of all , they simply refuse to shut up . thoughts of the three stooges led me back to the laugher , and his enjoyment suddenly made a lot more sense . it's actually a bit of an insult to the stooges to compare them to the ponderous shenanigans of joe and gus , except to note that the audience may find the mayhem similarly appealing . the less stooge-inclined may consider them nothing but a pair of foreheads waiting for a swinging two-by-four . now _that_ would be comedy . </review>
<id>2373</id><review>i have a theory that , in an earlier stage of development , the premise for a simple wish went something like this : murray ( martin short ) , who aspires to being the first male fairy godmother , turns out to be completely inept at the job , but an affirmative action mandate forces the godmothers to admit him . this would be before the real-world affirmative action debate heated up , forcing controversy-shy universal executives to drop that angle entirely . the theory , i'll admit , is based on no evidence in the version of a simple wish which actually made it to the screen . the alternative , unfortunately , is that the story never made a shred of sense at _any_ point in its development . it's the kind of exasperating kiddie fantasy where stuff just happens , without any character , story or internal logic to guide it . of course , the stuff which does happen may be plenty to satisfy young viewers . the special effects are , admittedly , temporarily distracting . martin short , who should be taken only in small doses even on his best days , turns murray into a flinching , snorting and generally annoying creation without a glimmer of charm . mara wilson , who was so appealing in last year's delightful matilda , barely registers here at all , while francis capra registers far too often as wilson's big brother . there is not a single likeable character in the film , turning every scene into a long wait for some kind of goofy visual effect to snap you out of your stupor . all of these problems make the gaping hole at the center of the film all the more evident . a simple wish is based around a high-concept premise -- a male fairy godmother , and an incompetent one at that -- yet not once is there any attempt to explain why he wanted to be a fairy godmother , how he managed to become one , or why no one is keeping an eye on him . in fact , a simple wish is comprised of nothing but missed opportunities and half-developed ideas . does it matter that murray is using a broken wand for much of the film ? time and again , a simple wish wanders from scene to scene as though blissfully unconcerned about arriving at anything resembling a point . then again , maybe someone got cold feet and stripped it of its point . it's more charitable , i think , to imagine the darkly satirical film a simple wish might have been than to dwell on the muddled mess it turned out to be . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

<id>2374</id><review>screenplay : kevin meyer and keith samples . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , sexual situations , profanity ) running time : 95 minutes . a plot synopsis for a smile like yours reads like the most generic of bittersweet romantic comedies . sounds quite a bit like she's having a baby , doesn't it ? only it's more like she's _not_ having a baby , because a smile like yours is a bittersweet romantic comedy about infertility . that's right , all the wacky hijinks of masturbating into a cup ! all the side-splitting humor of spending an hour in stirrups ! i can understand the temptation to search for humor in a subject as frustrating , embarrassing and occasionally guilt-inducing as fertility problems . perhaps either writer/director keith samples or his co-writer kevin meyer had some personal experience in this area , and felt the need to share their quest for a smile amidst the tears . and it might have worked if they had bothered to include a single honest moment in a smile like yours . there is no attempt to understand how danny and jennifer really feel about their dilemma , no sense of any genuine pain . samples and meyer have merely grafted a few scenes at a fertility clinic onto a fluffy and absurdly predictable relationship comedy , forcing you to wonder why it couldn't just as easily have been about a couple struggling with financial problems , or an irritating relative , or the heartbreak of psoriasis . it's actually fairly impressive how generic and predictable a smile like yours turns out to be . the casting certainly doesn't help matters , offering the mundanely attractive kinnear and holly as our protagonists without once stepping inside their heads ( we never learn why jennifer is so underhanded about trying to get pregnant , considering danny seems perfectly comfortable with the idea ) . even the supporting cast -- jay thomas as the acerbic guy pal , joan cusack as the daffy gal pal -- appears to have been generated by a computer program . the film is so ennervated for so long that a late cameo by shirley maclaine provides virtually the entire energy quotient in three minutes of screen time . for an hour and a half a smile like yours trudges in the most obvious directions , reaching a grating climax in a scene where several agonizing seconds pass between the moment we _know_ jennifer is going to call danny's hotel room and find another woman there , and the moment the phone actually rings . infertility may be a delicate issue , but it's hardly sacrosanct . a competent film-making team might have made either an exaggerated black comedy or a more sensitive comedy-drama about the issue . it deserves much better than to become an afterthought in a story which has nothing creative or insightful to offer on any subject . you know you're in trouble when the biggest laugh in a film comes during a scene when a character is watching a rerun of " i love lucy " . . . and the laugh is actually _at_ the rerun of " i love lucy . " lucy is still funnier -- and more inventive -- after 40 years than a smile like yours is after 40 minutes . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . </review>
<id>2375</id><review>screenplay : jeb stuart and philip morton . director : felix enriquez alcala . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 98 minutes . in an uncertain world , there's something strangely reassuring about the films of steven seagal . the economy may rise and fall , but seagal will always dispatch all adversaries with the same vaguely bored smirk and without a hair in his ponytail drifting out of place . you can't depend on political institutions , but you can depend on the fact that seagal will put together a wardrobe where nary a pastel nor a t-shirt will be found . all else changes , but seagal stays the same -- the same facial expression , the same tone of voice for every emotion , the same humorless self-importance . he is stasis personified . there's not much new to say about fire down below , because there's not much new to see . and none of those bones ever belong to seagal's character . a seagal fight sequence is uniquely monotonous not just because the hero always wins -- action heroes usually win -- but because no one ever lays a finger on him . i doubt seagal will ever make a truly thrilling action thriller ( and yes , that includes under siege ) because his ego could never permit any doubt as to the outcome ; his action scenes are like harlem globetrotters games without the showmanship . it's that ego of his which makes so many seagal films so wonderfully , terribly predictable . when he stops fire down below dead in its tracks to give a mini-version of his on deadly ground speech on environmental responsibility , you know it's because he genuinely believes someone cares what he thinks on the subject . -- you know it's because he's not about to take orders . and when he tries to work up some sensitive romantic chemistry with marg helgenberger , you want to laugh out loud at the idea that he could love anyone as much as he loves himself . sure , you can always count on a few token surprises , most of them completely ridiculous . there's a needless and unpleasant subplot about incestuous siblings -- nothing like dismantling appalachian stereotypes -- and a few colorful bursts of conveniently fluorescent toxic goop . mostly , however , there's more of the same fight-chase-explosion narrative structure and automoton emoting which makes the latest steven seagal film a natural sequel to the last steven seagal film . there's nothing remotely entertaining about fire down below , but there's something steadying about seagal's artistic intransigence . in turbulent times , you can almost take comfort in the knowledge that one man's name is as good as a plot description . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . </review>
