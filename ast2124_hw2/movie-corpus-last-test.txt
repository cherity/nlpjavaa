<id>2371</id><review>producers : ivan reitman and joel silver . director : ivan reitman . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 101 minutes . i don't even need to have seen the infotainment show interviews of billy crystal and robin williams to know the substance of them . " well , " billy/robin would say , " robin/billy and i have been looking for a long time for a project where we could work together , and fathers' day seemed like the perfect opportunity . " " yeah , " robin/billy would then chime in , " we had a great time making it . " whereupon would ensue much good-natured riffing between the two , guaranteed to have the hosts chuckling merrily as we returned to the studio . for those uninitiated in promo-speak , allow me to provide a translation . the real plot of fathers' day is robin williams and billy crystal running around being robin williams and billy crystal . that plot shouldn't have been too hard to pull off . crystal and williams are funny , talented men , and the screenwriting team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandel has produced charmers like splash , parenthood and city slickers . fathers' day , however , isn't merely disappointing . it is one of the laziest and most ineptly constructed comedies of the decade . i spent 101 minutes staring at a screen in blank-faced astonishment , waiting for this group of talented people to show me something remotely entertaining . of course , i knew the answer to that question . they were thinking that they had robin williams and billy crystal , and that everything else would just sort itself out . fathers' day is filled with scenes where it looked like the script consisted of the phrase " robin does something crazy here . " it is the rare film which has made good use of williams' improvisational skills -- good morning , vietnam comes to mind . more frequently , a careless creative team like this one will use williams as a comedic " in-a-gadda-da-vida " drum solo , filling time between " fade in " and " fade out . " crystal isn't even _that_ lucky , consigned with the rest of the cast to picking up whatever scraps williams leaves behind . he plays the felix unger in this odd couple road show , maintaining the same vaguely perturbed expression for roughly the entire film . you might think fathers' day would be built around the conflict between the opposing personalities of the two leads -- crystal as the uptight lawyer and williams as the unhinged creative type -- but you'd be wrong . williams and crystal hardly raise their voices to one another , perhaps fearing that the audience only wants to see them as funny chums . respectively , they provide the opportunity to watch a mosh pit full of head-butting and a port-a-potty sliding down a hillside . thanks for coming . most critics tend to reserve their greatest outrage for films featuring pauly shore , chris farley or even jim carrey , perhaps believing that moronic physical comedy is what's wrong with modern film-making . i consider fathers' day more contemptible by far . whatever else one might think about farley or carrey , they give everything they've got to a role . the performances are lifeless , the plot incorporates that over-used trope of the workaholic who gets religion about family life , and the dialogue is so devoid of creativity that it re-cycles a gag about the odds of lou gehrig dying of lou gehrig's disease ( comparative stories about how long ago you first heard that one mailed to this address , please ) . i'm sure the stars had a wonderful time making fathers' day , just like burt reynolds , dom deluise and company had a wonderful time making those cannonball run movies . as the credits started to role , i began to hope that fathers' day would include out-takes , something to justify my time . they also would have provided a fitting post-card coda for a film which amounts to a working vacation for robin williams and billy crystal at our expense : " having a good time -- glad you were there .

<id>2372</id><review>screenplay : jill mazursky cody and jeffrey abrams . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , violent situations ) running time : 92 minutes . i was sitting next to a laugher as i watched gone fishin' . when i say " laugher , " i don't just mean someone who laughs loudly , or someone who laughs frequently . i mean someone who laughs loudly _and_ frequently . the most innocuous line of dialogue was greeted with a hearty chuckle , while a full-fledged sight gag inspired the kind of explosive bellow which i was certain would cause a loss of bladder control . if disney had test-screened gone fishin' for an audience comprised entirely of clones of this fellow , the champagne corks would have been popping like bubble wrap in the hands of a 10-year-old . under most circumstances , the laugher would have annoyed me to distraction . in the case of gone fishin' , the distraction was welcome . the film's breathtaking awfulness forced my mind to wander in sheer self-defense , leading me to spend a lot of time thinking about what a splendid time the laugher was having . as a critic , it is sometimes useful for me to confront how uniquely personal the movie-going experience can be , particularly when it comes to comedy . in my world , gone fishin' was a complete catastrophe . in the laugher's world , it was an unqualified delight . there's certainly nothing inherently clever about the premise . and that , ultimately , is what gone fishin' is about . in other words , it's in the tradition of the slapstick-y live-action comedies disney made when dean jones and kurt russell were foiling the nefarious schemes of joe flynn and cesar romero in various permutations . at least those concoctions were fast-paced and enthusiastically silly . for every two minutes of action in gone fishin' there are at least twenty minutes of inane chatter between pesci and glover . the two are supposed to be lovable , incurably optimistic simpletons , but someone forgot to spend any script time on the " lovable " part . joe and gus are dull , immature and , worst of all , they simply refuse to shut up . thoughts of the three stooges led me back to the laugher , and his enjoyment suddenly made a lot more sense . it's actually a bit of an insult to the stooges to compare them to the ponderous shenanigans of joe and gus , except to note that the audience may find the mayhem similarly appealing . the less stooge-inclined may consider them nothing but a pair of foreheads waiting for a swinging two-by-four . now _that_ would be comedy . </review>
